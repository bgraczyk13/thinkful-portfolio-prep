    <!-- ABOUT -->
    <article>
      <h2 class="border-top">About Me</h2>

        <p>Prior to Covid-19 I was an automechanic specializing in body work. Once things started to unfold, I was laid off from work and had to find a different career path that would allow me to stay employed if something like this were to happen again in the future. I graduated from Devmountain bootcamp in February of 2021, and am now attending Thinkful to take my career to the next level!</p>

        <p>Check out my Portfolio using React! It has a few prior works I've done before attending Thinkful. <a href="https://portfolio-fixed.web.app/">Click here!</a></a>

        <p>With some experience working in a team setting before, I am beyond excited to be working with others!
          Paired programming is extremely beneficial, and working with others has always helped me learn new things.
          Networking and a willingness to reach out to others makes Thinkful a great setting for me to be in. I'm excited to start this journey!
